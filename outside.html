    <p class="blackstory">You follow the pizza delivery man outside to discover that his car has disappeared, and you know he never left because you didn't hear his car. SUDDENLY, out of nowhere you hear a rumbling from the sky...<br><br> A UFO appears out of thin air. Its ray points at you, and you start rising through the air towards it. I would tell you more, but that's a story for another time.</p>
